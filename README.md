# GlSnippets

A collection of classes that I use commonly in OpenGL programs/apps.

Ideally this will get implementations of:
* Isosurfaces
* Particles
* Floating ink simulations

# Goals

Goals that I'm not too serious about. That is, I will try to have all these
rely on a framework:

* Framework-neutral
* Super dumb easy
